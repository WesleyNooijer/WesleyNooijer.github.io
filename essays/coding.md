# Why code is valuable
Why is software valuable? How does it actually help us in our daily lives?

To answer this, let's first look at what software is. Software, or code, essentially tells computers (hardware) what to do. Computers, in turn, are devices that store and process information (data) based on the instructions given by this software. Computers can process anything that can be 

Asking why software is valuable thus means asking why it is so valuable to tell powerful information processors what to do. 



So, computers are a tool that can process information, and software specifies how this processing should be done. As humans, we have been using tools for thousands of years to improve different aspects of our lives. Tools that helped us hunt, tools that helped us farm lands, and tools that helped power the industrial revolution (the steam engine). What all of these tools have in common, is that they allowed humans to get more work out of their energy.

Software (code), combined with hardware (computers) on which it can run, is the most powerful tool we have ever invented. Computers can do work in fractions of the time that it would take humans to do. What's more, they can do things that are physically impossible for humans. 

While the hardware is essential to this, the scalability of software makes it so valuable. Software is made up out of bits, hardware out of atoms. And bits can be duplicated at basically zero cost, atoms cannot. 

Because software scales, it is possible to write code once, and have millions of people use it without any extra work. Code makes it possible to get exponential returns from work, rather than the traditional linear returns in which one hour of work always pays the same. This is the core idea of "Build Once, Sell Twice" a phrase coined by Jack Butcher, and of "Permissionless leverage", a term used by Naval Ravikant in his famous "How to get rich without being lucky" tweetstorm. This concept applies not only to code, but also to online media, such as blog posts, podcasts, and videos. 

Software is eating the world. Moore's Law moving faster than other things. 

Learning to code is learning how to transfer your thoughts into a computer. It is the same as language. In essence, language is the transfer of my thoughts to your mind. 

We could consider technology as the fourth dimension of our reality. An extension of our reality. Having the ability to shape this reality is valuable.
