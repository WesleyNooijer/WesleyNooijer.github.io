    <p>@manoliskellis, professor in computational biology at MIT, recently appeared 4 times on the @lexfridman podcast. 

      His excitement and incredible insight made for truly special episodes. 

      A thread of some of my favourite ideas discussed in the episodes around biology and life:</p>
    <p>1/ <br>Life supersedes physics and the brain supersedes life.

      Life resists the natural processes of the world outside of its body #123 43:57 (episode & timestamp)
      
      In turn, the brain can decide not to follow what life was programmed for (i.e. survival and reproduction) #123 1:03:45</p>
    <p>2/ <br>Our germline is compartmentalized in the cell nucleus.
        Everything outside that is packaging that helps passing this information on. 
        
        Your brain, senses, consciousness, your body, all the tools you have to enjoy life, all just auxiliary to the germline. #123 47:49</p>
    <p>3/ <br> Our new ability to detect gravitational waves essentially gave us a new sense: something in the physical world that we can perceive. #123 1:02:29 How much more of the physical world can we not perceive because we do not have the senses for it?</p>
    <p>4/ <br>There is a master metabolic switch in our DNA. Like a switch, one change in a specific nucleotide can flip cells from an obese phenotype to a lean phenotype. From fat storing to fat burning. #133 1:47:10</p>
    <p>5/ <br>A unified theory of human disease is inevitable. #133 57:08 

      You cannot solve disease by focusing on one gene anymore. "Traditional biology is dead." 
      
      A systematic approach is required and *will* lead to a complete map of the circuitry of the human body. #133 2:08:18</p>
    <p>6/ <br>New generations of technologies that help us measure, understand, and intervene with biology at many different levels are going to drastically alleviate disease and transform our species.

      The 21st century will be remembered for the big leaps in biology.
      
      #133 2:13:40 2:16:19</p>
      <p>7/ <br>We are not the inventors of the first digital computer. We are the descendants of the first digital computer. 
        <br>
        <br>
                Life is digital. 
                
                Information is stored and passed on to new generations without loss. #113 3:55</p>
    <p>8/
      <br>There are 2 types of inheritance: vertical (DNA) and horizontal (ideas). Culture is our collective genome.

      Delayed development of our brain wiring allows us to rely more on education rather than hardcoding everything into DNA #113 11:29</p>
    <p>9/ <br>The ambiguity of language can be a feature rather than a bug. Language takes meaning at the receiver. The fact that you will not interpret my words exactly as I intended them can spark creativity and lead to new ideas. #113 1:55:42 2:12:10</p>
    <p>10/<br>New ideas are what enabled us to progress so rapidly over the millennia #142 1:03:52

      If you could learn only one thing from @manoliskellis, let it be an appreciation of the importance of knowledge transfer. 
            
      His utter joy in participating in that process is inspiring.</p>
    <p>I cannot recommend the @lexfridman podcast, and the episodes with @manoliskellis in particular, enough. 

      I will link the videos of these episodes below. There are so many more great ideas to be found in them so do check them out!</p>
