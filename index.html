        <h1>Hi, I'm Wesley, a bioinformatics student based in Utrecht.</h1>
        <hr> 
        <p>This website represents a curated collection of new ideas in science and technology. The collection
          consists of ideas that I found most interesting and which I see as most significant for society. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of the major topics included on this website are: Biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Nanotechnology, Blockchain, and Virtual Reality.
        </p>
        <p>
         All ideas are collected in a public Roam Research graph. The major advantages of collecting ideas in Roam
         are the linking of ideas and the reusability of blocks of information. It is my hope that this will aid in 
         the understanding of ideas and how they relate to other ideas.
        </p>
